# ✅ Design Update Complete - Final Polish (v2)

I have applied the requested design changes to **ALL** authentication pages (Customer & Restaurant) and fixed all UI inconsistencies, including hidden sections.

## 🎨 Changes Applied

### 1. Glassmorphic Centered Design
- All login/signup forms are now centered on the screen.
- Applied a **glassmorphism effect** (blur + transparency) to the form card.
- Removed the right-side image panel for a cleaner, modern look.

### 2. Icon Removal (Comprehensive)
- **Input Field Icons**: Removed all icons from the left side of input fields.
    - Email & Password (Login/Signup)
    - Name & Phone (Signup)
    - **Referral Code** (Signup) - *Fixed*
    - **Confirm Password** (Signup) - *Fixed*
    - **OTP Phone Number** (Login) - *Fixed*
- **Tab Icons**: Removed icons from the "Restaurant" and "Customer" switch tabs.

### 3. Logo Update
- Replaced the image logo with a large, gradient text logo: **"Dooeats"**.

### 4. UI Fixes & Polish
- **Mobile Padding**: Fixed an issue where input text was indented on mobile devices.
- **Password Toggle**: Increased the size of the eye icon for better visibility.

## 🚀 How to Test

Both servers are running! You can check the pages now:

1.  **Customer Login**: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/login](http://127.0.0.1:8000/login) (Check OTP section too)
2.  **Customer Signup**: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/signup](http://127.0.0.1:8000/signup) (Check Referral Code)
3.  **Restaurant Login**: [http://127.0.0.1:8001/login](http://127.0.0.1:8001/login) (Check OTP section too)
4.  **Restaurant Signup**: [http://127.0.0.1:8001/register](http://127.0.0.1:8001/register) (Check Confirm Password)

The design is now truly consistent across all sections.
