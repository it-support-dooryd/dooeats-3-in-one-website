# Project Documentation

This document provides an overview of the project's file structure, API endpoints, core functionality, and a list of pages for each application.

## Project File Structure

This project is built using the Laravel framework, featuring a modular architecture with a main application, an administrative panel (`admin/`), and a restaurant-specific application (`restaurant/`). Each application largely follows the standard Laravel directory structure.

Here's a breakdown of the key directories and their typical contents:

*   **`/` (Root Directory)**: Contains the main Laravel application, along with the `admin/` and `restaurant/` sub-applications. It includes core configuration files, `composer.json`, `package.json`, and the `public/` directory for web-accessible assets.

*   **`app/`**: Houses the core code of the main application, including controllers, models, providers, and other application-specific logic.

*   **`admin/`**: This directory contains a separate Laravel application for the administrative panel. It has its own `app/`, `resources/`, `routes/`, and other standard Laravel directories, allowing for independent management of the admin interface.

*   **`restaurant/`**: Similar to the `admin/` directory, this contains a dedicated Laravel application for restaurant-specific functionalities. It also has its own `app/`, `resources/`, `routes/`, etc.

*   **`bootstrap/`**: Contains framework bootstrap files and cache directories.

*   **`config/`**: Stores all the application's configuration files (database, mail, services, etc.).

*   **`database/`**: Holds database migrations, seeders, and factories.

*   **`public/`**: The web server's document root. Contains compiled assets (CSS, JS), images, and the `index.php` file which is the entry point for all requests.

*   **`resources/`**: Contains raw assets (Sass, JavaScript), language files, and Blade templates (`views/`).

*   **`routes/`**: Defines all the application's routes (web, API, console, channels).

*   **`storage/`**: Used for storing compiled Blade templates, file-based sessions, file caches, and other files generated by the framework.

*   **`tests/`**: Contains unit and feature tests for the application.

## API Endpoints

The project exposes API endpoints through `api.php` files in the main, admin, and restaurant applications. All API endpoints are protected by `auth:sanctum` middleware.

### Main Application (`/routes/api.php`)

*   `GET /api/user`: Retrieves the authenticated user's information.
*   `POST /api/delete-user`: Deletes a user from the database. (Handled by `App\Http\Controllers\ApiController::class, 'deleteUserFromDb'`)

### Admin Panel (`/admin/routes/api.php`)

*   `GET /admin/api/user`: Retrieves the authenticated user's information within the admin context.

### Restaurant Application (`/restaurant/routes/api.php`)

*   `GET /restaurant/api/user`: Retrieves the authenticated user's information within the restaurant context.
*   `POST /restaurant/api/delete-user`: Deletes a user from the database. (Handled by `App\Http\Controllers\ApiController::class, 'deleteUserFromDb'`)

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
